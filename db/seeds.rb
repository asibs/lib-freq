# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# Purposefully left empty for the moment. It's possible some static seed data might be required for all
# projects / campaigns in future, but for project / campaign specific seed data you should use the custom_seed
# job (see lib/tasks/custom_seed.rake). Custom seed data should be placed in db/seeds/<my_seed_data>.rb, and
# can be run using rails db:seed:my_seed_data
